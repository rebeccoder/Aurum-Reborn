## Design Choices 

The design choices for Aurum Reborn's website were inspired by a wide range research of other high-end jewellery websites. I sought to create a minimalistic and elegant platform, exuding a touch of luxury and femininity.

By observing successful design elements from the industry and infusing my own artistic touch, the websites aim to offer visitors an immersive and captivating experience that beautifully showcases the collection of exquisite jewellery pieces.

#CDA3A3 was used for the delivery banner and as a accent colour for buttons and hovering

## Testing

There was an issue that the Stripe Secret Key and other information had been commited to Github.
These have since changed and are no longer relevant to the keys now used in the website.

<strong> No automated testing has been used on this project, Instead all the testing has been done manually and through numerous user experiences. </strong>

<strong> Navigation and Site Flow:</strong> Tested how easily users can navigate through the website, find products, and access different sections. Check if the site flow makes sense and is intuitive for users by navigating through all the pages and make sure all the links are working so that a user doesn't get stuck anywhere.

<strong>Checkout Process:</strong> Tested the checkout process to see if it's straightforward, secure, and doesn't have any barriers that might discourage users from completing their purchases. I did this by using Test Cards provided by stripe and going through the whole checkout process multiple times with different items and card details.

<strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Verified that the search feature works effectively and provides relevant results to help users find what they're looking for quickly.

<strong>Product Filtering and Sorting:</strong> Tested how users interact with the product filtering and sorting options to refine their search results based on their preferences made sure that it was correctly displaying the products as per the requested filters and sorting choice.

<strong>Creator Page Usability:</strong> Evaluated how easily users can access and explore the creator's page, view their information, and understand the stories behind the creators. Did this as an admin too and went through the editing and deleting processes to make sure they're all working

<strong>Testimonials:</strong> Went through the testimonial process from start to finish as a logged in user and also logged into other accounts to make sure that only the logged in user who added the testimony can access the edit and delete pages.

<strong>Performance and Load Times:</strong> Evaluated the sites loading time, it was very slow and needed to compress all the images and reupload them. This has drastically improved the speed of the website.

<strong>Toast Messages:</strong> Ensured all toast messages display as and when expected, they are fully functioning for users to interact with and they are consistent and easily noticeable.

### Responsiveness Testing

To ensure a smooth user experience across various devices, specific scenarios and devices were used to evaluate different aspects of the website's adaptability:

<strong>Laptop and Desktop Testing:</strong> The website was tested on laptops and desktop computers with various screen sizes, ranging from 13 inches to 27 inches. This testing covered scenarios like resizing the browser window and checking for layout adjustments at different resolutions.

<strong>Mobile Devices:</strong> Testing was conducted on popular smartphones and tablets, including iPhone and Android devices. Different screen sizes, orientations, and touch interactions were analyzed.

<strong>Google Chrome Dev Tools:</strong> Utilizing Google Chrome Dev Tools, the website's responsiveness was tested on a wide range of emulated devices, including iPhones, iPads, Android phones, and tablets. The "Device Toolbar" feature allowed for detailed examination of layout and functionality on simulated devices.

<strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> The website was tested on multiple browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. This verification process ensured a consistent user experience, irrespective of the browser used.

<strong>Touch-Friendly Elements:</strong> Interactive elements, such as buttons and navigation menus, were thoroughly tested for touch responsiveness on touch-enabled devices to guarantee a seamless experience for mobile users.

<strong>Toast Messages:</strong> The behavior of toast messages, used for displaying alerts and notifications, was examined on various devices to ensure they appeared and disappeared correctly and did not disrupt the user experience.

<strong>Forms and Inputs:</strong> Testing involved checking the behavior of form elements and inputs, such as text fields and dropdowns, on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure they were easy to interact with and provided appropriate feedback.

### Bugs
* <strong>Problem:</strong> Mobile Logo Display
* <strong>Cause:</strong> The mobile logo was not displaying on mobile screens due to missing responsive classes.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Add the appropriate responsive classes (d-block d-lg-none) to the logo element to show it only on small screens and hide it on larger screens.

---

* <strong>Problem:</strong> Navbar Misplacement
* <strong>Cause:</strong> After hiding the mobile logo, the navbar was shifted to the left, likely due to the hidden element's layout.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Instead of using `display: none` to hide the logo, use `visibility: hidden` to keep the layout structure intact.

---

* <strong>Problem:</strong> Missing Logo on Mobile
* <strong>Cause:</strong> The logo was not showing on mobile screens even after applying responsive classes.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Check for CSS conflicts or other custom styles that might be affecting the visibility of the logo. Use browser developer tools to inspect the element and ensure no other styles are overriding the visibility.

---

* <strong>Problem:</strong> Hidden Elements Still Displaying
* <strong>Cause:</strong> After hiding certain elements on mobile screens, some elements like the search bar and font-awesome icons were still visible.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Add the appropriate responsive classes (d-block d-lg-none or d-none d-lg-block) to hide or show elements on specific screen sizes as needed.

---

* <strong>Problem:</strong> Mobile Navigation Redesign
* <strong>Cause:</strong> The requirement was to redesign the mobile navigation to have all elements (burger icon, logo, search icon, profile icon, and shopping bag icon) on one line.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Restructure the HTML and use flexbox classes like d-flex, justify-content-between, and align-items-center to align the elements in a single line.

---
* <strong>Problem:</strong> Footer Logo Display
* <strong>Cause:</strong> The footer logo image was not displaying on certain pages (e.g., product info page, edit product page, product management page) due to the incorrect path used for the image source (src) attribute in the template file.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> Update the image source (src) attribute in the template file to point to the correct location of the footer logo image. Ensure that the correct relative path or absolute path is used to access the image from the project-level media directory. Verify that the image is accessible from the specific pages where it is intended to be displayed.

---
* <strong>Problem:</strong> Unexpected side scroll
* <strong>Cause:</strong> A margin that was caused by using certain Bootstrap elements, namely the row elements without wrapping the 'container-fluid' class in a div.
* <strong>Solution:</strong> After downloading the Chrome extension Pestiside I was able to find what element exactly was causing the margin. I looked into it on StackOverflow and found out more about the containers and rows and decided 'container-fluid' was the best option

---



### Unresolved Issues
- Couldn't get the delivery banner to stay closed once the close button had been pressed. It will on the page the users on when exiting but not if they navigate to another. This will need to be fixed if going live as it causes an inconvenience to the user.

## Deployment

- The final Deployed site can be found [here](https://aurum-reborn-46fdfe47f435.herokuapp.com//)
- I have included details of my initial deployment in a separate document called [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).
